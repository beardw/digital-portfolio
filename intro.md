```{tab-item} Things I learned.
- Using the terminal was helpful if an error was generated.
- There are *lots* of options when it comes to formatting your book to how you would like it.
- Tinkering is the best way to learn and see how and why things turn out the way they do. This helps give a better understanding of how everything comes together.
```

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult.
- Not everything works on the first try.
- Sometimes I didn't understand how all the syntax came together.
- Knowing what was possible and how/where to search for it. (Outside of the helpful links provided.)
